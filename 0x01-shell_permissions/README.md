In Week Three of the Foundation of Linux course, I learned about file permissions and how they control access to files and directories in a Linux system. I studied the different permission types: read (r), write (w), and execute (x), and how they apply to the file owner, group, and others. I practiced using the chmod, chown, and chgrp commands to change permissions and ownerships. This week also introduced basic user management, including how to create new users and groups, and how to assign users to groups. These concepts are important for system security and managing shared access in a multi-user environment.
