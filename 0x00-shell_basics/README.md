In Week Two of the Foundation of Linux course, I learned about the importance of version control and how it is used to track changes in files over time. We explored Git, a powerful version control system, and practiced using commands like git init, git add, git commit, and git log. I also learned how to create branches, switch between them using git checkout, and merge changes with git merge. This week helped me understand how version control improves teamwork, prevents data loss, and makes it easier to manage updates in projects. Using GitHub, I was also able to push changes to a remote repository and collaborate more effectively with others.
